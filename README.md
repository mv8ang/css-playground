# css-playground
Some of the very first experiments I did with CSS. 
Some of them more successful than others, but each has something that could be reused.

They're not documented properly, because they're not intended for public use.
Feel free to use them though, the code is super straight-forward.

# DESCRIPTION:

## 1up
A grid experiment that turned into pixel art, spiced up with funky background colours
## MAY CAUSE SEISURES!
-------------

# deadpr0ject
A play of pseudo-elements to create a deadmau5 mask. The eyes actually tune up to most of his beats!
# COOL AS FUCK
# COOL AS FUCK

-------------

# Search
A super sweet animation I made for fun. Could actually be used in production.

-------------

# Spotlight
A cool effect if used subtly(er than me). Simple js applies a class with an animation to spans on hover.

-------------

# Transform
Same as spotlight, but without the javascript, so no fancy fades. Cooler colours though!

-------------

# underline-me
I love this thing and I don't know why.
